<h1>Any Nuggets Of Wisdom?</h1>
<p> The short answer is no, but if you wanted the short answer you wouldnt have stayed long enough to navigate to the 4th page in this website. The following will be collection of tid-bits for you, dear reader.
</p>
<h4>Oil For Cutting Tools</h4>
<p>Use cooking oil as a protectant on any edged tools you plan to use for cooking. Using another protectant like WD-40 or Hoppes #9 can inadverntantly poison any food it comes in contact with. 
</p>
<h4>Military Surplus?</h4>
<p>Military surplus equipment ususally provides a cheap, tough and dummy-proof solution for many needs/wants while out in the bush. The most consistent trade-off is weight. More expensive civilian 
designed gear will usually weigh less than rugged military gear designed for individuals with double digit IQ's.
</p>
<h4>Infant Named Jeb</h4>
<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
 Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? 
 Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
</p>
<h4>Tec-9</h4>
<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do 
you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're 
actually proud of that shit.
