<h1>What do I need to bring?</h1>
<p> Dave Canterbury has a very succinct description of the basic elements required to survive in the elements. They are known as the "5 C's of Survivability" and they are as follows: cutting tool, combustion device,
cover, container, cordage. Some of these items are more necessary than others, but they create a great starting place to ensure the basics are covered.
</p>
<h4>Cutting Tool</h4>
<p>There are many different kinds of cutting tools and what is best for you will ultimately be a matter of experience and objective. A well made full-tang fixed-blade knife will come in handy for many different tasks. 
I own a Becker BK-7 and due to the heft of the knife it can almost fill the role of a small hatchet. Another consideration to make is the availability of firewood. In order to process logs into usable
firewood I would suggest having a small saw like a Silky Zubat or Silky Pocketboy. In addition to this saw a small Hunting/Hiking axe will add alot of utility at the cost of weight. A Hultafors Hunting Axe will enable you
to process fair sized logs without much effort. I must stress again that you should do your own research to find reliable brands that can provide tools to fit your needs and plans. Avoid marketplaces like Amazon as the tools
listed there often overpromise and underdeliver. 
</p>
<h4>Combustion Device</h4>
<p>This is a device required in order to start a fire. Depending on your situation this can range from a comfort option to a life or death decision. Many of these options are quite cheap and I would encourage you
to try several. Bring lighters, matches, wind/water proof matches, pre-made fire starter plugs, ferrocerium rods. Learn what works for you. The most important tenant here is redundancy. You can save a few ounces in your
bag and spend a chilly evening if you like. 
</p>
<h4>Cover</h4>
<p>This is your temporary home. It should be as light as possible and multipurpose. This option most heavily depends on your environmental circumstances. A solid military surplus tent will serve you well in most situations
but will not have the options that many higher price point tents have. It will also more than likely weigh more than a more expensive tent designed for civilian use. For my personal use I have a French Army surplus 
F1 tent. Along with your covering you are going to want to consider what kind of sleeping arrangement you will need. Bare in mind that a sleeping bag alone will provide very minimal protection against conduction. The ground will
suck the heat right out of your body so an insulating layer between the ground and your sleeping arrangement will be necesary in colder environments. These pads can range from blow-up mattresses to simple woolen blankets. What works
best for you will depend heavily on your own preferences and the environment you find yourself in. The best teacher is experience. Go spend a few uncomfortable nights in the woods and you'll figure it out.
</p>
<h4>Container</h4>
<p>Another vital item is your container. Water is an absolute necesity and making sure you bring enough and have the means to create more drinkable water is vital. I use the military option again for this item, but many people 
prefer stainless steel bottles and canteen/canteen cup sets. I use a plastic 1-liter canteen to contain my potable water. The canteen cup comes in handy to create more potable water as it can be placed in the fire to boil
water found on site making it safe to drink. It should be noted here that in order to make your drinking water safe it should be filtered to clear all particulate and then boiled for 1-3 minutes.
</p>
<h4>Cordage</h4>
<p>This is the item you never think you need until you do. Cordage can be made of an almost innumerable number of things and used to lash a structure for shelter, lash items to your pack, and create a field expedient splint 
for a twisted ankle. This is, of course, just a few things it is useful for. The choice really comes down to availability and experience. I prefer a good roll of 550 Paracord, but mroe experienced survivalists will create
their own cordage from plant fibers and happy thoughts. 
</p>
<aside>
As an aside: Cutting tools especially are subject to local laws. I must stress again that you do your own research to ensure you follow local laws and guidelines.
