<h1>So You Wanna Go Camping?</h1>
<p>So, you wanna go camping but the prospect of starving or freezing to death is disrupting your efforts. Recreation in the 
outdoors is proven to reduce stress and improve your connection with the world outside our human designed bubbles. 
Hopefully this guide will be able to provide a bit of insight on the reccomended gear, locations, things to consider when
settings up camp and some generally sound advice. Alot of the information I am gonna provide may or may not be useful depending
on your intentions and previous experience. A large part of camping is adapting to the environment you find yourself in.
Therefore, a bit of experience will teach you far more than this series of bad webpages ever will. Lets just get the basics
to get out there and learn for yourself.

<aside>
Due to legality surrounding camping and camping gear I highly encourage you to explore local laws to ensure you dont end 
up in any legal trouble. Good resources to investigate is whatever government agency maintains the public parks and wildlife
reserves. If they dont have the answers for you they should be a good first stop and should be able to point you towards the appropriate resources.
