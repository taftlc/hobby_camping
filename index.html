<h1>So You Wanna Go Camping?</h1>
<p>Is the prospect of starving or freezing to death disrupting your efforts to plan and execute a fun trip to the great outdoors? Fret no longer. 
We are gonna get you fixed right up. Recreation in the outdoors is a great way to reduce stress and improve your connection with the world outside. 
Hopefully this guide will be able to provide a bit of insight on the reccomended gear, locations, things to consider when
settings up camp and some generally sound advice. Alot of the information I am gonna provide may or may not be useful depending
on your intentions and previous experience. A large part of camping is adapting to the environment you find yourself in.
Therefore, a bit of experience will teach you far more than this series of bad webpages ever will. Lets just get the basics
to get out there and learn for yourself.

As an aside: All of the following advice is subject to your local laws. I take no responsibility for any laws you may or may 
not break in the process of pursuing this activity. I highly encourage you to explore local laws to ensure you dont 
end up in any legal trouble. Good resources to investigate is whatever government agency maintains the public parks 
and wildlife reserves. If they dont have the answers for you they should be a good first stop and should be able to 
point you towards the appropriate resources.
