<h1>Where Should I Go?</h1>
<p> Generally while camping you are going to want to find an area that is well drained, sheltered and fairly flat/even. From experience I can say that camping on water-logged ground over an underground stream provides
for a soggy and cold experience. Try to find a spot where the ground is as dry as the environment allows. Wind is another consideration. A flat open field may seem like a great place to set up until mother nature rips that tent
off you at 3 AM. Trees can provide great cover from the wind, but be aware of limbs falling as a hazard and avoid single trees as they can attract lightning strikes. And even ground will ensure you dont become an overnight
yoga expert as the forces of gravity twist you into a pretzel in one corner of your tent.
