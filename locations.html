<h1>Where Should I Go?</h1>
<p> Generally while camping you are going to want to find an area that is well drained, sheltered and fairly flat/even. From experience I can say that camping on water-logged ground over an underground stream provides
for a soggy and cold experience. Try to find a spot where the ground is as dry as the environment allows. Wind is another consideration. A flat open field may seem like a great place to set up until mother nature rips that tent
off you at 3 AM. Trees can provide great cover from the wind, but be aware of limbs falling as a hazard and avoid single trees as they can attract lightning strikes. And even ground will ensure you dont become an overnight
yoga expert as the forces of gravity twist you into a pretzel in one corner of your tent.

<h1>How Should I Get There?</h1>
<p> As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I don't want to be rescued. Fetal stemcells, 
aren't those controversial? I never loved you. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. 
Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were 
actually wriggling through them. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. 
Fry, that doesn't make sense. You guys go on without me! I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal!
